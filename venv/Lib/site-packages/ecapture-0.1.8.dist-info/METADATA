[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/ecapture)](https://pepy.tech/project/ecapture)    [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/ecapture/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/ecapture/month)    [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/ecapture/week)](https://pepy.tech/project/ecapture/week)
## Image Capture Demo

First run the following command in a cmd window
~~~
pip install ecapture
~~~

Then, Create a new python script

Open the script

Import the module
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec
~~~ 
Capture using webcam
~~~python
(ec.capture(0,False,"img.jpg"))
~~~
The capture function takes three arguments:

  Camera index(first connected webcam will be of index 0. The next webcam will be of index 1)

  Window name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to see the window, type False)

   ~~~python
   ec.capture(0,False,"img.jpg")
   ~~~

  Save name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to save the image, type False)
  ~~~python
  ec.capture(0,"test",False)
  ~~~
The full code
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec

ec.capture(0,"test","img.jpg")
~~~
## Delayed Image Capture Demo
Create a new python script

Open the script

Import the module
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec
~~~ 
Capture the image using webcam
~~~python
ec.delay_imcapture(0,"Image","Demo.jpg",2)
~~~
The delay_imcapture function takes four arguments:

  Camera index(first connected webcam will be of index 0. The next webcam will be of index 1)

  Window name (It can be a variable or a string)

   ~~~python
   ec.delay_imcapture(0,"Video","Demo.jpg",2)
   ~~~

  Save name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to save the image, type False)
  ~~~python
  ec.delay_imcapture(0,"Video",False,2)
  ~~~

  The delay(The time till capturing the image)
  ~~~python
  ec.delay_imcapture(0,"Video","Demo.jpg",2)
  ~~~
The full code
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec

ec.delay_imcapture(0,"Video","Demo.jpg",2)
~~~
## Video Capture Demo
Create a new python script

Open the script

Import the module
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec
~~~ 
Capture the video using webcam
~~~python
ec.vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi","q")
~~~
The vidcapture function takes four arguments:

  Camera index(first connected webcam will be of index 0. The next webcam will be of index 1)

  Window name (It can be a variable or a string)

   ~~~python
   ec.vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi","q")
   ~~~

  Save name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to save the video, type False)
  ~~~python
  ec.vidcapture(0,"Video",False,"q")
  ~~~

  Exit key (The key you press to stop recording the video. It can be ("q", "x", "a" or any other letter))
  ~~~python
  ec.vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi","x")
  ~~~
The full code
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec

ec.vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi","q")
~~~
## Auto Video Capture Demo
Create a new python script

Open the script

Import the module
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec
~~~ 
Capture the video using webcam
~~~python
ec.auto_vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi",5)
~~~
The auto_vidcapture function takes four arguments:

  Camera index(first connected webcam will be of index 0. The next webcam will be of index 1)

  Window name (It can be a variable or a string)

   ~~~python
   ec.auto_vidcapture(0,"Vid","Demo.avi",5)
   ~~~

  Save name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to save the video, type False)
  ~~~python
  ec.auto_vidcapture(0,"Video",False,5)
  ~~~

  Exit time (The time until stopping recording of the video. It can be (5, 10, 15, 20 or any number of seconds in between)
  ~~~python
  ec.auto_vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi",10)
  ~~~
The full code
~~~python
from ecapture import ecapture as ec

ec.auto_vidcapture(0,"Video","Demo.avi",5)
~~~
## Motion Detection
Create a new python script

Open the script

Import the module
~~~python
from ecapture import motion as md
~~~ 
Check for movement using webcam
~~~python
md.motion_detect(0,"x",0.85,"Detection")
~~~
The motion_detect function takes four arguments:

  Camera index(first connected webcam will be of index 0. The next webcam will be of index 1)

  Key to stop checking for motion. It can be ("q", "x", "a" or any other letter)

  Window name (It can be a variable or a string. If you don't wish to see the window, type False)

  Threshold(any value from 0-1)If threshold is set to high value(0.6-1), even the slightest movement will be detected. 
  And if threshold is set to a low value(0-0.59), only more rapid monement will be detected

The full code
~~~python
from ecapture import motion as md

md.motion_detect(0,"x",0.85,"Detection")
~~~
